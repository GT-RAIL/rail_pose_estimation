# RAIL (Human) Pose Estimation Metapackage

This repository contains nodes and packages that we use for human pose estimation. All methods of pose estimation publish poses in the message formats defined in [`rail_pose_detection_msgs`](rail_pose_detection_msgs/).

**Note on Licensing**

We try to be as permissive with our LICENSE as we can (we use an MIT license), but sometimes our dependencies use a different license. As a whole, this repository is released under the MIT license, but the estimator package at this time is released under a non-commercial license, as mandated by the detection package that it employs.
